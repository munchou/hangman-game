### Retrieving a copy of the "depository"

- `git clone https://github.com/munchou/hangman-game.git` (not super necessary but hey, you manage your own soup)

or download the ZIP file and extract it in a chosen folder.

### Starting the game
To run the game, open the "start-game.bat" file or, in your terminal, enter:
- `python main.py`

To add words to the JSON file, you can either directly edit the file or use the program I made for that purpose by opening the "add_a_word.bat" file or by entering:
- `python add_a_word.py`

### Features
- Language choice (English and French, but you can edit the files and add your own).
- "Drawings" of the gallows and stick dude.
- Right/wrong entered letters are displayed (in their respective list).
- Health "bar".
- At the end of a game (either victory or defeat), the definition of the picked word is displayed. Playing is fun, knowledge is essential.
